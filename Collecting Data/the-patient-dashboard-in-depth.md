# The Patient Dashboard In Depth

The Patient Dashboard is the place to view or edit a patient record, and add new Visits and Encounters.

The Patient Dashboard appearance may be changed by modules. This chapter will show the dashboard as it looks without modules.  



## Finding or Creating a Patient

To begin, we must find or create a patient. This is done from the Find/Create Patient link on the top menu.

Creating patients is explained in the [Registering Patients](registering-patients.md) chapter.

## Header

 The header bar appears at the top of the dashboard. It contains a summary of some patient details:  name, ID number, gender, age and birthdate, weight, and regimen. There will be a link to any visit in progress.  If no visits are in progress, one can be begun with the **Start Visit** button.

## Overview Tab

The Overview tab gives access to several patient features. 

If a patient is a member of any Program (configured in Administration &gt; Programs), it will be displayed here.

The **Exit Patient from Care** button in the Patient Actions section will end the patient's participation in any program.

The **Relationships** tab shows relationships between the Patient and other patients, providers, or users in the OpenMRS installation. The default relationship types include parent-child, sibling, doctor-patient, and aunt/uncle-niece/nephew. You can add relationship types in Administration &gt; Person &gt; Manage Relationship Types.

Allergies are listed in the **Allergies** box.

Use the **Problem List** to highlight ongoing health problems.

## Regimens Tab

## Visits/Encounters Tab

The Visits tab shows all of the patient's encounters, grouped into visits. If the Visits feature is disabled, the tab will be named Encounters.  

To start a new visit, click the **Add Visit** link in the Visits tab, or the **Start Visit** button in the header.

To view a visit, click the link with the visit's name. If a user has editing privileges, the visit will open in edit mode.

In edit mode, you can add or remove encounters from the visit.

To view an encounter, return to Patient Dashboard  &gt; Visits tab. Click on the View icon to the left of the encounter. If a user has editing privileges, the encounter will open in edit mode. 

_An encounter opened in edit mode. For this example, we used the FormEntry module to create and display the encounter._

View the patient's address and names from the Demographics tab. The **Edit Patient** links will let you edit the patient's information, including identifiers, birth and death dates, and relationships.
