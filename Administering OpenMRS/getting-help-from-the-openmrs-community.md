# Getting Help from the OpenMRS Community

![_A 2011 meeting of the OpenMRS community in Kigali, Rwanda._](/assets/implementers-2011.png)

OpenMRS is supported by a vibrant community. Whether you need help installing, using, updating or extending OpenMRS, you can find help in a variety of places.

## OpenMRS ID

OpenMRS ID is an account used to participate in most of the community resources to support implementers and developers, and is required to use most of the tools on this page. Learn more about OpenMRS ID and sign up online

[https://id.openmrs.org/](https://id.openmrs.org/)

## OpenMRS Wiki

Documentation for OpenMRS is available in the wiki.

[http://wiki.openmrs.org](http://wiki.openmrs.org/)

You can find information for users and developers, as well as details of shared modules and other resources.

You can search for information in the wiki using the search bar at the top of the page. Alternatively, use the links on the left of the page to navigate to the relevant section.

If you find an error in the information on the wiki, please correct it if you can! If you do not already have an OpenMRS ID, you can register for free using the **Sign Up** link at the top of the page. After logging in, you will see an **Edit** button at the top of most pages. Click this button, make your changes, and click **Save**. If you are not certain about making an edit, just leave a comment on the page with your questions or concerns. We appreciate your help!

## OpenMRS Talk forums

Most of the discussion within the community occurs within [OpenMRS Talk](https://talk.openmrs.org/) available at:

[https://talk.openmrs.org/](https://talk.openmrs.org/)

The implementers mailing list is a community mailing list for people using, considering using, or otherwise interested in OpenMRS. You can ask questions, seek advice, and learn from others on the mailing list. Search the archives for similar problems before you post - someone else may have already answered your questions!

## Ask OpenMRS

Ask OpenMRS is a safe place to ask questions about installing and using OpenMRS and to get answers from others in the community.

[https://ask.openmrs.org/](https://ask.openmrs.org/)

If you ask a question and get some answers, please be courteous by selecting the best answer (this helps people that come later with the same question to more easily find the best answer). As you gain experience, help contribute to the community by helping the answers of others in the community.
